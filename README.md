# Calculating New Market Beta proposed by Welch (2019)
[Welch (2019)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3371240) introduces a novel method for calculating Market Beta that outperforms traditional estimators in predicting future OLS market-beta.

Empirical research has shown that the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) does not hold, making it challenging to reliably predict future returns using market Beta. However, Market Beta is still valuable since since investors want to hedge against market risk factor. The Welch Method outperfom other measures in calculating the Market Beta. 

## What is this measure?

1) it uses daily stock returns instead of monthly returns as inputs. (We need 250 daily stock return) 
2) Employs a smooth exponential aging process for past returns, accounting for the time-varying and mean-reverting nature of true betas
3) it removes outliers in daily stock return. (Welch propose to winsorize daily stock return by delat of 3 around market return. For instance, if daily market retrun is 5%, the range for daily stock return is (1 Â± 3): (-2, 4) of market return or -10% and 20%. )

## Download the data: 
We need historical daily return to calculate the measure. I use the data from CRSP on WRDS. This data can be downloaded directly from WRDS or using Python. In the code [download_data](https://github.com/aghalandar/New-Market-Beta/blob/8cf9237f13b62c18f4a66222f34ef6bbbf835c20/download_data.ipynb), I use WRDS connection to download the CRSP data. Alternatively, other databases with similar data can be used to achieve comparable results.
